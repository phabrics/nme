# this automake include file must be included in all directories that
# build modules.  it updates the modules index that will be installed
# along with all of the modules, and also handles some static building
# details.  this is done with an all-local target:
all-local:
#
# first, all source files in the current directory are searched for
# element "new" function declarations.  these declarations provide
# enough information to determine the published module name, the
# libtool module name, and "submodule" name.  this information is
# appended to a tme-plugins.txt file, which will be installed in
# $(pkglibdir).
#
# the choice of $(top_builddir)/tme/tme-plugins.txt is important.
# when debugging, the person doing the debugging is expected to have
# the good sense to set LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH to $(top_builddir), so
# module.c will correctly use the uninstalled plugins list for all
# "tme/" modules.
#
# this is abuse of the $(top_builddir)/tme directory, yes, since
# this directory was originally just for include files and to make
# #include <tme/FOO.h> work right when building:
	@echo updating tme modules list..
	@grep TME_ELEMENT_NEW_DECL $(srcdir)/*.c |		\
	sed -e 's%.*TME_ELEMENT_NEW_DECL(\(.*\)).*%\1%'		\
	>> $(top_builddir)/tme/tme-plugins.txt
	@grep TME_ELEMENT_SUB_NEW_DECL $(srcdir)/*.c |		\
	sed -e 's%.*TME_ELEMENT_SUB_NEW_DECL(\(.*\),\(.*\)).*%\1_\2 \1 \2%' \
	>> $(top_builddir)/tme/tme-plugins.txt
	@grep TME_ELEMENT_X_NEW_DECL $(srcdir)/*.c |		\
	sed -e 's%.*TME_ELEMENT_X_NEW_DECL(\(.*\),\(.*\),\(.*\)).*%\1\3 \1\2 \3%' \
	>> $(top_builddir)/tme/tme-plugins.txt
#
# next, when building statically, either for debugging purposes or
# because we're on a weak platform, we have to use libtool's "preopen"
# mechanism.
#
# this means at least specifying all of the modules that could
# potentially be lt_dlopen'ed on any main program's link command line,
# using libtool's -dlpreopen option.
#
# so we append suitable -dlpreopen options for all modules built in
# this directory to a file, in this case
# $(top_builddir)/tme-preopen.txt.  when building statically,
# configure.in will then substitute @TME_PREOPEN@ with: 
#
#  `cat $(top_builddir)/tme-preopen.txt`
#
# else it will substitute the empty string.  when linking programs,
# @TME_PREOPEN@ is then used on the program's link command line.
# 
# additionally, libtool, at least through version 1.5, has a
# limitation in that the pseudo-library (the .la file) must be present
# even for a preloaded module.  if we aren't debugging, everything is
# installed, so this is not a problem.
#
# however, if we are debugging, nothing is installed, so we have to do
# something to make sure that the .la files can be found.
#
# the person doing the debugging is already expected to set
# LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH to the top of the build directory, so that
# module.c can find the uninstalled tme-plugins.txt file, and libtool
# will want to look in this directory for .la files, so we simply copy
# all of the .la files into that same directory:
	@if test "x$(pkglib_LTLIBRARIES)" != x; then		\
	    for module in $(pkglib_LTLIBRARIES); do		\
		echo $$module ;					\
		echo -dlpreopen ../$(subdir)/$$module >> $(top_builddir)/tme-preopen.txt ; \
		cp $$module $(top_builddir)/tme ;		\
	    done ;						\
	fi
