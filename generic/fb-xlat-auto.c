/* the central feature of these translation functions is the "bit
   FIFO", a first-in, first-out stream of bits.  source bit FIFOs are
   used to read pixel bits out of source images, and destination bit
   FIFOs are used to write pixel bits into destination images.

   a bit FIFO has a visible part and an invisible part.

   the visible part of a bit FIFO is 32 bits wide, meaning the
   translation code can read (for a source bit FIFO) or write (for a
   destination bit FIFO) up to 32 bits of pixel data before a bit
   FIFO shift.

   the invisible part of a source bit FIFO contains pixel bits that
   have already been read from the source image memory, but that have
   yet to be shifted in to the visible part.

   the invisible part of a destination bit FIFO contains the pixel
   bits that have been shifted out of the visible part, but that have
   yet to be written to the destination image memory.

   depending on various attributes of an image format, it may be
   possible for the translation code to always read or write the
   entire 32 visible bits of a bit FIFO at a time, and as a result
   always shift the bit FIFO 32 bits at a time.  this is desirable
   because it minimizes bit FIFO shifts.

   when this does happen, it may also be the case that the visible
   part of the bit FIFO always perfectly corresponds to an aligned
   32-bit word in the image buffer.

   this is the optimal situation, as it makes it unnecessary to track
   the invisible part in C local variables at all - each 32-bit FIFO
   shift of a source bit FIFO just reads the next 32-bit word directly
   into the visible part, and each 32-bit FIFO shift of a destination
   bit FIFO just writes the next 32-bit word directly out of the
   visible part.

   within the visible part of a bit FIFO, which bits belong to which
   pixels depends on the "order" of the image format.  most-significant
   (big-endian) images have earlier (more to the left on the screen)
   pixels in more-significant bit positions.  least-significant
   (little-endian) images have earlier pixels in less-significant bit
   bit positions.

   bit significance *within* a pixel never depends on image order.
   once the bits belonging to a pixel have been identified according
   to image order, the least significant bit in that pixel's value is
   always the bit with the least absolute value.

   some pictures may help explain this better.  each picture shows the
   32 bit visible part of a bit FIFO, with the bits marked from 0
   (least significant) to 31 (most significant).  all of these
   examples are for a two-bit-deep/two-bits-per-pixel image, and in
   the visible part sixteen pixels are numbered.  lesser numbered
   pixels are earlier (more to the left on the screen).  some of the
   invisible part is also shown, along with the direction that the bit
   FIFO shifts in:

  each translation function has at least one source bit FIFO and at
  least one destination bit FIFO.  the general idea is to read source
  pixel value(s) from the source image, map those source pixel
  value(s) somehow into destination pixel value(s), and write those
  destination pixel value(s) to the destination image.

  translation functions that do not scale the image have exactly one
  source bit FIFO and exactly one destination bit FIFO.  one pixel
  read from the source bit FIFO becomes one pixel written to the
  destination bit FIFO.

  translation functions that halve the image size have two source bit
  FIFOs and one destination bit FIFO.  one source bit FIFO sources
  bits from an even-numbered scanline, and the other sources bits from
  an odd-numbered scanline.  four pixels read from the source bit
  FIFOs - two from each source bit FIFO, making a 2x2 square - become
  one pixel written to the destination bit FIFO.

  translation functions that double the image size have one source
  bit FIFO and two destination bit FIFOs.  one destination bit FIFO
  sinks bits for an even-numbered scanline, and the other sinks bits
  for an odd-numbered scanline.  one pixel read from the source bit
  FIFO becomes four pixels written to the destination bit FIFOs -
  two to each destination bit FIFO, making a 2x2 square.

  translation functions don't necessarily always translate the entire
  source image into the entire destination image.  instead, the buffer
  holding the current source image is expected to be twice as large as
  necessary (plus some overhead), with the second half of the buffer
  holding a copy of the last translated ("old") source image.

  before setting up and translating pixels using bit FIFOs, a
  translation function treats the the current and old source images as
  an array of aligned 32-bit words and compares them.  if it finds no
  32-bit word that has changed, no translation is done and the
  function returns.

  otherwise, initial source pixel x and y coordinates are derived from
  the offset of the 32-bit word that failed comparison, and the source
  primary bit FIFO is primed.  if this translation function halves the
  image size, the source secondary bit FIFO is primed from the same x
  coordinate on the "other" (think y ^ 1) scanline.

  then, initial destination pixel x and y coordinates are derived from
  the initial source x and y coordinates, and the destination primary
  bit FIFO is primed.  if this translation function doubles the image
  size, the destination secondary bit FIFO is primed from the same x
  coordinate on the "other" (think y ^ 1) scanline.

  as mentioned previously, the buffer holding the current source image
  is expected to be twice as large as necessary (plus some overhead),
  with the second half of the buffer holding a copy of the last
  translated ("old") source image.

  this "overhead" is approximately two extra scanlines worth of data,
  that is initialized to all-bits-zero and must always remain zero.
  this extra data is present at the end of both the current ("new")
  and last translated ("old") source images.

  these extra, always-blank scanlines guarantee that the pixel
  translation loop terminates.  the pixel translation loop *never*
  checks for the end of the image buffer.  instead, it terminates only
  after it has read in TME_FB_XLAT_RUN consecutive aligned 32-bit
  words that have *not* changed between the new and old source images.
  this small amount of extra memory overhead simplifies the pixel
  translation loop, because it doesn't have to worry about going past
  the end of the actual image.

/* macros: */

/* given a 32-bit aligned pointer into the current source image, this
   returns the corresponding 32-bit aligned pointer in the last
   translated ("old") source image.  since the old source image
   follows the current source image, this is simple pointer arithmetic
   using src_bypb: */
#define TME_FB_XLAT_SRC_OLD(raw)				\
  ((tme_uint32_t *) (((tme_uint8_t *) (raw)) + src_bypb))

/* when the fast, aligned 32-bit word comparison loop finds a word
   that has changed in the source image, pixels are translated until
   TME_FB_XLAT_RUN consecutive aligned 32-bit words are processed that
   have *not* changed in the source image, at which point the fast
   comparison loop resumes.

   the idea is that after you've started translating pixels, once the
   FIFO shift operation has read TME_FB_XLAT_RUN consecutive raw,
   unchanged 32-bit words, all of the pixels from previous, changed
   32-bit words have been translated and shifted out of the source bit
   FIFO(s), and all bits remaining in the source bit FIFO(s) are for
   pixels in those unchanged 32-bit words.  since the pixels are
   unchanged, pixel translation can stop, and the entire state of the
   source bit FIFO(s) can be discarded.

   so, each time a raw, changed 32-bit word is read, xlat_run is
   reloaded with TME_FB_XLAT_RUN, and each time 32 bits worth of
   source image pixels are processed, it is decremented.  when it
   reaches zero, the source bit FIFO(s) are discarded, the destination
   bit FIFO(s) are flushed, the pixel translation loop breaks and the
   fast comparison loop continues: */

     translation* the visible part of the bit FIFO is guaranteed
     to correspond to an aligned 32-bit word in the image buffer.

     this is *not* so if any of the following are true:

     - the destination bits-per-pixel value is not known at compile
       time.  in this case, we can't unroll the translation loop
       for destination pixels, and are forced to shift the FIFO
       after each one.

     - if src_fifo0_may_be_unaligned is true.  in this case, we
       definitely can't guarantee that any initial dst_x will
       correspond to an aligned 32-bit word in the destination buffer.

     - if the destination image is not packed.  in this case, there may
       be undisplayed pixels in the FIFO, which we will need to
       shift out.

     - if there are 24 bits per destination pixel.  in this case,
       a destination pixel may cross a 32-bit boundary.

     - if a possible initial dst_x doesn't correspond to an aligned
       32-bit word in the destination buffer.  for this last one:

     since we require that src_fifo0_may_be_unaligned is zero, we
     know that the initial src_x = (Z * 32) / src_bipp for 
     some Z.  we also have the initial dst_x = src_x * 2.
     the initial destination bit offset will then be:

     (dst_skipx + dst_x) * dst_bipp
     = (dst_skipx * dst_bipp) + (dst_x * dst_bipp)

     if we additionally require that (dst_skipx * dst_bipp)
     be 32-bit aligned, this reduces things to:

     dst_x * dst_bipp
     = (src_x * 2) * dst_bipp
     = (((Z * 32) / src_bipp) * 2) * dst_bipp

     which will be a multiple of 32 iff:

      ((1 / src_bipp) * 2) * dst_bipp >= 1 and integral

     or, equivalently:

       ((dst_bipp * 2) % src_bipp) == 0
